# 🗓️ Day 27 – JavaScript Review + Start Portfolio

## 🧠 Focus Areas:
A quick and effective review of core JavaScript concepts, followed by starting your **JavaScript-based portfolio** project!

---

## ✅ JavaScript Review Topics

### 🔹 1. Variables
Variables are used to store data.

```js
let name = "Areeba"; // block-scoped, can be updated
const age = 22; // block-scoped, cannot be changed
var city = "Lahore"; // function-scoped (not recommended)
```
Tips:

Use let and const, avoid var

const is used when value should not change

🔹 2. Loops
Loops are used to repeat actions multiple times.

Examples:

```
// For loop
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

// While loop
let count = 0;
while (count < 3) {
  console.log("Hello");
  count++;
}
```

🔹 3. Functions
Functions allow you to organize code into reusable blocks.

```
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name;
}

console.log(greet("Areeba")); // Output: Hello, Areeba
```

Arrow Function:

```
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
🔹 4. DOM Manipulation
DOM (Document Object Model) lets you interact with the HTML elements using JavaScript.
```

// Select an element
```
const heading = document.querySelector("h1");

// Change its text
heading.textContent = "Welcome to my Portfolio!";
Other examples:

document.getElementById("myId");
document.querySelector(".myClass");
element.style.color = "blue";
```
🔹 5. Events
JavaScript can respond to user actions using event listeners.

```
const btn = document.querySelector("button");

btn.addEventListener("click", function () {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});
```
Common Events:

click

mouseover

submit

keydown

🧑‍🎨 Start Your JavaScript Portfolio
Now that you’ve reviewed all core topics, it's time to begin your Portfolio Project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Ideas for JS Features:

Interactive buttons

A small form with validation

DOM-based content changer (like theme switch)

A JavaScript-powered image slider or counter

Structure Example:

/portfolio-project
│
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js
🔁 Practice Task:
Create a simple portfolio homepage

Add 1-2 sections using DOM manipulation

Use event listeners to add interactivity

🎯 Goal:
By the end of the day, you should:

Be confident with basic JavaScript concepts

Have started your own interactive portfolio project
